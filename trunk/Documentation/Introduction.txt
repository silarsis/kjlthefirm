The Firm is a game based on running an IT company (or consulting in an IT
environment).  This document lays out the design so far.

Basic premise:

Users will login and register themselves as new users.  They will be given a
certain number of points to buy starter skills, and will then be cast into the
market.

In the market, users will be able to bid on jobs available.  Jobs will come
from a variety of customers, and will require certain amounts of certain skills
to complete.  The advertised amounts and skills may not match the actual
amounts and skills.

Users will be able to band together into companies, or enter into ad-hoc
arrangements for joint bidding on particular jobs.

Networking is crucial - while there will be a central marketplace, there will
also be many jobs going that are only available if you are known to the
customer.

Finally, this is a web + email game - events will happen in realtime, on a
1:1 time scale, and new jobs and events may be emailed to users if they elect
to receive emails.
